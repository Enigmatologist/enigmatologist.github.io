        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          This project is a one-page website that acts as a promotional product showcase page for Jumpstart. Jumpstart is a mobile application I designed that allows people to crowdfund donations for charities, foundations, and specific causes.  
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Challenge</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc_end">
          The aim for this project is to design and develop a responsive product showcase website for a mobile application.

        <h5 class="subtitle">Wireframes</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          This time around I used Balsamiq to create my wireframe. When designing the layout of the page I wanted the main focus to be on downloading the application. However, the download action needed to be accessible to users who were visiting from both a mobile device and desktop.  In order to accomplish this, I elected to include the “Text me a download” button.
          <br>
          <br>
          I made the page short enough to accommodate users who are impatient to scroll down, but impactful enough to highlight the main features of the application. At the bottom of the page the site also includes another download section with click to action buttons as a one last reminder.

        <h5 class="subtitle">Final Development</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          The final product website was developed using the CSS Wizardry Grid by Harry Roberts, CSS3/SCSS, and HTML. I’ve had some experience working with Bootstrap before, but never with the Harry Roberts Grid. I was glad I learned how to use it because in my opinion it’s a very underrated grid system. The approach I took in developing the website was mobile first. Since maintaining a responsive site is no longer a luxury I made it a priority to learn this methodology so I can continue to prototype web products fully in the future.

        <h5 class="subtitle">Design for everyone</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          Don’t just think about the users you are designing for. Think about the development team. They will be the builders of your vision so design in detail. Optimize the images you use. Use a grid, know your grid, and adhere to the grid. Don’t get too curvy. Code and curves are not too friendly in this digital era. Maybe one day. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Develop in mobile first</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc_end">
           Starting out your development process in mobile first allows you to work smarter and not harder. I’ve been through the pain of developing for desktop then moving down to mobile and it always translates to more code, which leads to poor performance. Do yourself a favor and always go with mobile first.
