        <h5 class="subtitle">Background</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          This project is a one-page website that acts as a promotional product showcase page for Jumpstart. Jumpstart is a mobile application I designed that allows people to crowdfund donations for charities, foundations, and specific causes.  
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Challenge</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc_end">
          The aim for this project is to design and develop a responsive product showcase website for a mobile application.

          The style guide for this project is the same one I created for the Jumpstart mobile application.

        <h5 class="subtitle">Wireframes</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          This time around I used Balsamiq to create my wireframe. When designing the layout of the page I wanted the main focus to be on downloading the application. However, the download action needed to be accessible to users who were visiting from both a mobile device and desktop.  In order to accomplish this, I elected to include the “Text me a download” button.
          <br>
          <br>
          I made the page short enough to accommodate users who are impatient to scroll down, but impactful enough to highlight the main features of the application. At the bottom of the page the site also includes another download section with click to action buttons as a one last reminder.

        <h5 class="subtitle">Final Development</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          The final product website was developed using the CSS Wizardry Grid by Harry Roberts, CSS3/SCSS, and HTML. I’ve had some experience working with Bootstrap before, but never with the Harry Roberts Grid. I was glad I learned how to use it because in my opinion it’s a very underrated grid system. The approach I took in developing the website was mobile first. Since maintaining a responsive site is no longer a luxury I made it a priority to learn this methodology so I can continue to prototype web products fully in the future.

        <h4 class="block_header">Lessons Learned</h4>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Swift and clean with your logo</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          There used to be a time when designers didn’t face the daily constraint of real estate. The brick and mortar environment that the industrial age produced offered the freedom to get as detailed as possible on their canvas’s. Fast forward to Apple’s iPhone invention and designers are now in an era of designing for spaces that are only as big as your thumb. As much fun as it can be to create something that looks fantastic in a magazine, when it comes to a mobile app be swift and clean. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Typography</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          Typography isn’t just about art it’s about technique. You must learn to understand and see how it has a psychological effect in relation to conveying a message. When your dealing with dark backgrounds it’s even more paramount to explore mixing it up so that the proper hierarchy is conveyed to the user.  
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Data visualization is for the strong</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc_end">
           I have been whipped and beaten by the Data Visualization Gods. No longer am I ignorant to the fact that thinking about how to express complicated graphical data in a small area is an easy feat. It took some time, but I really researched how some of the best data designers think when they approach visual data design. Always aim to provide value with your graph not just beauty.
