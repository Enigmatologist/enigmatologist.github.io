        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          Jumpstart is an iOS mobile application that allows people to crowdfund donations for charities, foundations, and specific causes. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Challenge</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc_end">
          To generate all of the design components that builds an iOS mobile application where donors and fundraisers can unite. Having already designed an Android application I wanted to push myself through a new paradigm where I would leverage the iOS Human Interface Guidelines as opposed to solely Google’s Material Design principles.

        <h5 class="subtitle">Persona Development</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          In order to concentrate on a persona that I could reference for the duration of the project I enlisted the help of two mobile lovers. 
        </p>
        <div class="persona_image">
          <a href="pdfs/jumpstart-personas.pdf" target="_blank">
            <img alt="Jumpstart Personas" src="images/images-jumpstart/personas_2x.jpg">
          </a>
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          The feedback was well balanced as both brought different perspectives to the usage of the app. One was interested in its donation capabilities while the other was concerned about its campaign abilities.
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Solving Needs: User Stories</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          At this stage I decided to design for 7 features. Through the discussions in my persona interviews simplicity for the donor and fundraiser needed to be the concept I shot for.
        </p>
        <div class="userstory_image">
          <a href="pdfs/jumpstart-userstory.pdf" target="_blank">
            <img alt="Jumpstart User Stories" src="images/images-jumpstart/user-story-2x.jpg">
          </a>
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          After outlining my user stories it was evident that for this project I was going to be challenged in taking a large amount of data and turning it into a simple design on a small screen. As I organized my user story spreadsheet I made sure to include my thoughts on what the flows would approximately look like to prepare for the visual flows.  
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Designing the Product: User Flows</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          It was time for some task flow drafting. I always like this part of the process. Finishing the visual user flows always leaves me feeling like I found a treasure map except the treasure at the end of this process is the finished product.
        </p>
        <div class="userflow_image">
          <a href="pdfs/jumpstart-userflow.pdf" target="_blank">
            <img alt="Jumpstart User Flow" src="images/images-jumpstart/userflow_2x.jpg">
          </a>
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle_desc_end">
          Here the user starts off at a discovery page where they’re able to browse projects. If they choose to set up an account they’ll get access to starting their own fundraiser along with the ability to keep track of all activity of their favorite projects.
        </p>

    <section class="concept_development">
      <div class="wrapper1">
        <h4 class="block_header">Ideate</h4>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Branding</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          For this occasion I really wanted to create a logo that inspired both the donor and the donee. The logo not only needed to be symbolic of the product, but also correlated with the name itself. As a result, I decided to brainstorm the name first before I moved into the logo phase. Back to my trusted mind map method it was. 
        </p>
        <div class="mindmap_image">
            <img alt="Jumpstart Mind Map" src="images/images-jumpstart/mind-map_2x.png">
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          I was between two names Jumpstart and Just Cause and I elected to go with Jumpstart. Why? Well, just cause. Haha. In all seriousness though, I wasn’t savvy enough to come up with a logo concept in quick fashion that would correlate with the name Just Cause. However, Jumpstart was the perfect back-up. Using Jumpstart allowed me to hit the mark on what it means to start something from nothing and helping those that are trying to do so.
          <br>
          <br>
          Translating the name to a logo was the next obstacle. I toyed with the idea of making some sort of mergence with the letter J and S, but it felt too ordinary. Sketching finally led me to the logo I longed for.
          <br>
          <br>
          The idea I wanted the logo to represent was “taking a leap of faith.” After close observation one can tell that the left half of the object looks like a curved J and the right half the S. Put them together and you’ve got a person taking that “leap of faith”, which is exactly what everyone in the Jumpstart community would be doing for each other.  
        </p>
        <div class="colorpalette_image">
          <img alt="Jumpstart Color Palette" src="images/images-jumpstart/color_palette_2x.png">
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          As for the color scheme I selected a dark blue to bring a certain amount of seriousness for both that are eager to start a fundraiser or donate. The supporting colors of amber and green were used as action colors to give off the emotion of warmth and ambition. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Wireframes</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          With time always being a priority I completed the wireframes for all of the pages in Sketch so I could visually see how the design would look and feel within the perimeters of a mobile UI.  
        </p>
        <div class="wireframe_link">
          <a class="js_link" href="images/images-fresh_chef/wireframes1x.jpg" target="_blank">VIEW WIREFRAMES</a>

        <div class="wireframe_image">
          <img alt="Jumpstart Wireframes" src="images/images-jumpstart/wireframe_total_2x.png">
        </div>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Mockups</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          Wireframing in Sketch proved beneficial as it propelled me quickly into the mockup phase. With most of the pattern work done in Sketch I was able to focus more on the typography and visual aspect moving forward.  
          <br>
          <br>
          Since I was designing for Android I made it priority to always design within the Material Design guidelines. Cards quickly became a pattern I fell in love with as I saw their potential to serve as an entry point to more detailed information. Their utilization emitted a sense of clarity and cleanliness that could bring forward the easy use of the application. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Informed Iteration</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc_end">
          I’ve used online usability testing resources before, but there’s nothing quite like asking real people. I conducted some preliminary user testing to get an understanding of how users were acting within certain portions of the application. With just a brief summarization, I tested various scenarios to see what areas users were struggling with. 
          <br>
          <br>
          From my testing, I found that users had issues with:
        </p>
        <ol class="listed_items">
          <li class="issues">Understanding how to read the menu cards</li>
          <li class="issues">Visibility of the item they were purchasing on the menu page</li>
          <li class="issues">Input fields on order page</li> 
          <br>         
        </ol>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">As a result, the following changes were made:</p>
        <div class="menus_image">
          <img alt="Menus" src="images/images-fresh_chef/menu_iteration2x.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          The page needed a redesign. Instead of having the user scroll through large blocks of menu content, the small menu cards replaced the old. This outcome was more clear and easy to quickly absorb.
        </p>
        <div class="orderpage_image">
          <img alt="Order Pages" src="images/images-fresh_chef/order_iteration2x.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          Two items needed to be reworked here. The input fields needed to be consistent throughout the application and the menu item needed to be simplified. In order to accommodate the latter, I used the application’s theme picture to act as the background and modified the location of the menu item to a place where users can easily be reminded what they are ordering.
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Prototype</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          I used InVision to make an interactive prototype for usability testing during the mockup stage. Below is the final version that includes all improvements that were made after user feedback.
        </p>

      <div class="wrapper1">
        <h4 class="block_header">Takeaways</h4>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Consistency</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          You must keep your design consistent. Patterns, visuals, buttons, and typography should all be equally distributed in their design through the application. It’s important that a user recognize what environment she is in. Consistent behavior calms the human brain. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">KISS</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          Keep it simple stupid. It’s easy to get carried away making things “oh so beautiful” but in the end all you’re doing is creating more work for the mind. Less is more.
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Who are you designing for?</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc_end">
           Don’t ever lose sight of who you’re designing for. Constantly ask yourself if your design represents your targeted persona.
