          Jumpstart is an iOS mobile application that allows people to crowdfund donations for charities, foundations, and specific causes. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Challenge</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc_end">
          To generate all of the design components that builds an iOS mobile application where donors and fundraisers can unite. Having already designed an Android application I wanted to push myself through a new paradigm where I would leverage the iOS Human Interface Guidelines as opposed to solely Google’s Material Design principles.

        <h5 class="subtitle">Persona Development</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          In order to concentrate on a persona that I could reference for the duration of the project I enlisted the help of two mobile lovers. 
        </p>
        <div class="persona_image">
          <a href="pdfs/jumpstart-personas.pdf" target="_blank">

          </a>
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          The feedback was well balanced as both brought different perspectives to the usage of the app. One was interested in its donation capabilities while the other was concerned about its campaign abilities.
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Solving Needs: User Stories</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          At this stage I decided to design for 7 features. Through the discussions in my persona interviews simplicity for the donor and fundraiser needed to be the concept I shot for.
        </p>
        <div class="j_userstory_image">
          <a href="pdfs/jumpstart-userstory.pdf" target="_blank">
            <img alt="Jumpstart User Stories" src="images/images-jumpstart/user-story-2x.jpg">
          </a>
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          After outlining my user stories it was evident that for this project I was going to be challenged in taking a large amount of data and turning it into a simple design on a small screen. As I organized my user story spreadsheet I made sure to include my thoughts on what the flows would approximately look like to prepare for the visual flows.  
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Designing the Product: User Flows</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          It was time for some task flow drafting. I always like this part of the process. Finishing the visual user flows always leaves me feeling like I found a treasure map except the treasure at the end of this process is the finished product.
        </p>
        <div class="userflow_image">
          <a href="pdfs/jumpstart-userflow.pdf" target="_blank">
            <img alt="Jumpstart User Flow" src="images/images-jumpstart/userflow_2x.jpg">

        </div>
        <p class="subtitle_desc_end">
          Here the user starts off at a discovery page where they’re able to browse projects. If they choose to set up an account they’ll get access to starting their own fundraiser along with the ability to keep track of all activity of their favorite projects.
        </p>

      <div class="wrapper1">
        <h4 class="block_header">Ideate</h4>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Branding</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          For this occasion I really wanted to create a logo that inspired both the donor and the donee. The logo not only needed to be symbolic of the product, but also correlated with the name itself. As a result, I decided to brainstorm the name first before I moved into the logo phase. Back to my trusted mind map method it was. 
        </p>
        <div class="mindmap_image">
            <img alt="Jumpstart Mind Map" src="images/images-jumpstart/mind-map_2x.png">
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          I was between two names Jumpstart and Just Cause and I elected to go with Jumpstart. Why? Well, just cause. Haha. In all seriousness though, I wasn’t savvy enough to come up with a logo concept in quick fashion that would correlate with the name Just Cause. However, Jumpstart was the perfect back-up. Using Jumpstart allowed me to hit the mark on what it means to start something from nothing and helping those that are trying to do so.
          <br>
          <br>
          Translating the name to a logo was the next obstacle. I toyed with the idea of making some sort of mergence with the letter J and S, but it felt too ordinary. Sketching finally led me to the logo I longed for.
          <br>
          <br>
          The idea I wanted the logo to represent was “taking a leap of faith.” After close observation one can tell that the left half of the object looks like a curved J and the right half the S. Put them together and you’ve got a person taking that “leap of faith”, which is exactly what everyone in the Jumpstart community would be doing for each other.  
        </p>
        <div class="colorpalette_image">
          <img alt="Jumpstart Color Palette" src="images/images-jumpstart/color_palette_2x.png">
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          As for the color scheme I selected a dark blue to bring a certain amount of seriousness for both that are eager to start a fundraiser or donate. The supporting colors of amber and green were used as action colors to give off the emotion of warmth and ambition. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Wireframes</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          With time always being a priority I completed the wireframes for all of the pages in Sketch so I could visually see how the design would look and feel within the perimeters of a mobile UI.  
        </p>
        <div class="wireframe_link">
          <a class="js_link" href="images/images-jumpstart/wireframesJS_1x.jpg" target="_blank">VIEW WIREFRAMES</a>

          <img alt="Jumpstart Wireframes" src="images/images-jumpstart/wireframe_total_2x.png">
        </div>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Mockups</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          During the mockup phase I made sure to capitalize on the contrast between my main theme and supporting colors. I wanted to make sure that users have no second thoughts on how to interact with the pages. Setting the main theme color as a background for many of the pages allows the action objects to pop more. Consequently, it leaves you with a feeling that someone is there to point you in the right direction.  
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Informed Iteration</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc_end">

          <br>
          The tests resulted with problems in the following areas: 
        </p>
        <ol class="listed_items">
          <li class="issues">Graphical information was not informative enough</li>
          <li class="issues">Fundraiser input pages were too overwhelming</li>
          <br>         
        </ol>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">As a result, the following changes were redesigned:</p>
        <div class="project_summary_image">
          <img alt="Project Summary Pages" src="images/images-jumpstart/p_summary_iteration_2x.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          It turned out that my original graph design provided limited value for a fundraising creator. I pushed myself further to really think about what type of information a creator would need when analyzing her campaign. Afterwards my redesign was much more informative, legible, and relevant. 
        </p>
        <div class="project_creation_image">
          <img alt="Project Creation Pages" src="images/images-jumpstart/p_creation_iteration_2x.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          The original concept of using a cursor symbol to indicate a form field had the opposite effect I had hoped for so I replaced it with a standard input line and softened its color. In addition, I changed the color of the option symbols to green to make it easier on the eye to interpret. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Prototype</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          After all research, testing, and revisions were complete I used InVision to make an interactive prototype. You can view the prototype at the link below.

        <h4 class="block_header">Lessons Learned</h4>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Swift and clean with your logo</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          There used to be a time when designers didn’t face the daily constraint of real estate. The brick and mortar environment that the industrial age produced offered the freedom to get as detailed as possible on their choice of canvas. Fast forward to Apple’s iPhone invention and designers are now in an era of designing for spaces that are only as big as your thumb. As much fun as it can be to create something that looks fantastic in a magazine, when it comes to a mobile app be swift and clean. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Typography</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc">
          Typography isn’t just about art it’s about technique. You must learn to understand and see how it has a psychological effect in relation to conveying a message. When your dealing with dark backgrounds it’s even more paramount to explore mixing it up so that the proper hierarchy is conveyed to the user.  
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Data visualization is for the strong</h5>
        <p class="subtitle_desc_end">
           I have been whipped and beaten by the Data Visualization Gods. No longer am I ignorant to the fact that thinking about how to express complicated graphical data in a small area is an easy feat. It took some time, but I really researched how some of the best data designers think when they approach visual data design. Always aim to provide value with your graph not just beauty.
